{"name":"Shimoneta-anti-pm-interface","tagline":"This mini project copies the countdown timer seen on Ayame's flip phone (from the anime 'Shimoneta')","body":"# Copy an Anime Countdown Timer in JS/jQuery/CSS\r\n\r\n##What is this?\r\nI copied the mobile countdown timer app from an [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoneta:_A_Boring_World_Where_the_Concept_of_Dirty_Jokes_Doesn’t_Exist). The app lets a character tell dirty jokes for a maximum of 3 minutes per day, without alerting the authorities (dirty jokes are forbidden in this anime world). \r\n\r\n##What are its Features?\r\nThe app looks and sounds just like the one in the anime. Users can start, stop and reset a working countdown timer from a maximum time of 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n##Why did I make this?\r\nI wanted to pretend like I had the secret timer app just like the main character has in the anime - the app was a unique app created by the father of one of the main characters. \r\n\r\n##What technology skills were learned/retrieved?\r\nI modified a javascript timer that I found in a stackoverflow answer by robbmj: \r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/a/20618517/4771469](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20618517/4771469)\r\n\r\nThe work involved javascript objects. \r\n\r\n##What are this project’s limitations?\r\nIn the anime, that app gives the user only 3 minutes per 24 hours, but this project is just a toy so it lets you reset the app to get 3 minutes whenever you feel like it. The app is supposed to require a special key code to activate it, but I have not included that. \r\n\r\nCurrently (as of 09/08/2015) the app does NOT respond to tablet or desktop sizes.\r\n\r\n##References\r\n###Fonts used for the app:\r\n* \"OPTIEdgar-Extended\" - [http://www.ffonts.net/OPTIEdgar-Extended.font.download](http://www.ffonts.net/OPTIEdgar-Extended.font.download)\r\n\r\n* \"telegrama_render\" - [http://yoworks.com/telegrama/index.html?utm_source=fontsquirrel.com&utm_medium=download_link&utm_campaign=Telegrama](http://yoworks.com/telegrama/index.html?utm_source=fontsquirrel.com&utm_medium=download_link&utm_campaign=Telegrama)\r\n\r\n* \"K22_Spotty_Face\" - [http://www.fontspace.com/toto/k22-spotty-face](http://www.fontspace.com/toto/k22-spotty-face)\r\n* \"larabiefont-free.regular\" - [http://www.1001fonts.com/larabiefont-free-font.html](http://www.1001fonts.com/larabiefont-free-font.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
